<section class="text">
    <p>I'm a Third Year Undergraduate student of the Department of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architechture at IIT Kharagpur.I'm deeply interested in Web Developing and Designing along with some experiences on Machine Learning and Data Science. I've worked on predicting delays, analyzing environmental patterns, and studying motion responses in water.I'm also insterested in ocean data analysis,computational fluid dynamics and numerical modelling in oceanography.</p>
    <p>Beyond technical work, I love applying what I learn to practical challenges, whether it's improving predictions, enhancing efficiency, or understanding physical phenomena through data. Always curious and excited to explore new ideas!</p>
